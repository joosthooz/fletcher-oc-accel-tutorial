    "# Overview of Fletcher\n",
    "Fletcher is a framework that creates an easy-to-use interface on both the hardware side and the software side. \n",
    "It works by generating hardware interfaces based on a \"schema\", which is the layout of the data in your big data analytics application.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fletcher overview](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher/raw/develop/fletcher.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Important to realize is that in most cases, a set of interfaces generated by Fletcher will not work if the schema changes.\n",
    "In that case, new interfaces need to be generated and the accelerator design needs to be adapted.\n",
    "Fletcher targets long-running workloads were the data layout does not frequently change, because these are the types of workload that warrant the design of an accelerator (in other words, if you do not know that your application will run for a very long time and the data layout will stay the same, you would not create an accelerator for it).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "Fletcher consists of several components;\n",
    "- Hardware generator cerata \n",
    "- Hardware library vhdlib that includes several basic hardware components such as FIFOs\n",
    "- Software runtime that provides the fletcher API to user applications\n",
    "- Examples\n",

    "## Documentation\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "As stated, we assume you are running the VM provided by the OpenCAPI course and have run the installation procedure from [this repository](https://github.com/joosthooz/fletcher-oc-accel-installscripts), which is included in [the course toplevel repository](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/opencapicourse_toplevel)."
